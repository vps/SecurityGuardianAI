## Scope of Work
The SecurityGuardianAI application has the following features:
* Continuous security auditing and monitoring
* Intelligent analysis and threat detection
* Real-time alerting and reporting system
* Easy to use interface for management and reporting

## System Architecture
The SecurityGuardianAI application will be built using an n-tier architecture. The application will consist of four main components.
* Presentation layer
* Business logic layer
* Data access layer
* Cloud monitoring layer

```

* The `presentation_layer` directory contains files that are used for building the web interface. 
* The `business_logic_layer` directory contains code for intelligent analysis and threat detection, while the `data_access_layer` directory contains code for data access. 
* The `cloud_monitoring_layer` directory contains the logging scripts. 
* The `logs` directory stores the log files. 
* The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of all the required Python libraries and packages that need to be installed for running the project. 
* The `README.md` file will contain the project documentation, and the `.gitignore` file will contain files and directories that need to be excluded from version control.

### Presentation Layer
The presentation layer will be a web interface that will be used to interact with the SecurityGuardianAI application. The presentation layer will be built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and will be hosted on a web server. The web interface will allow users to view, report, and manage any detected security threats.

### Business Logic Layer
The business logic layer will contain the core of the application logic, as well as the intelligent analysis and threat detection code. The business logic layer will be built using Python programming language and hosted on a separate application server. The application server will communicate with the monitoring layer and the data access layer to efficiently produce analysis and detection results.

### Data Access Layer
The data access layer will be responsible for storing and retrieving data from the application's databases. The data access layer will be built using Relational Database Management System, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to optimize data storage and retrieval when accessing data from the business logic layer.

### Cloud Monitoring Layer
The cloud monitoring layer will be responsible for collecting security information from the cloud server and sending it to the business logic layer for analysis. The cloud monitoring layer will be built using open-source log analyzers and visualizers, such as the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and Fluentd, to efficiently process and manage the server logs.

## Features
### Security Monitoring
The application will continuously monitor the cloud server for any security threats, such as unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Intelligent Analysis and Threat Detection
The application's business logic layer will analyze the collected data and use machine learning algorithms to identify potential security threats. The system must be able to detect threats in real-time and provide automated proactive measures to counteract any threats. 

### Real-time Alerting and Reporting System
The application will have a real-time alerting and reporting system that will notify the system administrators when security threats or vulnerabilities are detected. The alerts will be sent in real-time, through both the web interface and email, to ensure prompt management and resolution of any threats.

### Dashboard and Management Interface
The management interface will provide an error-free easy-to-use web dashboard that will give an overview of the current state of the cloud analytics. It will allow easier management and control over the cloud analytics process and provide insightful data on what is going on.
